        <p class="justify"> As an infant I was adopted from a small city just outside of Tampa, Flordia. My family of seven was comprised of six adopted African-American children chosen from various southern states. My parents, both white, from Utah and Idaho respecively. When I was five years old we moved from Boise, Idaho to Logan, Utah. There I would spend the next 14 years growing and becoming the man I am today. </p> 
        <p> When I was about 4 years old my parents intorduced me to sports. In my family, sports were a a big deal. My grandfather had played football for BYU back in the 1950's and had set the presidence for greaetness. My mom ensured that my brothers and I played and excelled at football. Growing up we were huge Utah State fans but at the end of the day there was only one option. </p> 
        <p> My senior year of High School I was set to be one of the top defensive backs in the state, I had two Division 1 Scholarship offers to play at Utah Tech University and Southern Utah University. These offers were great but they weren't enough. Mid-November my phone rang, it was the BYU Defensive Staff. They called to give me a schoalrship offer and I committed over the phone on the spot. The first person I called was my grandfather. We giggled and yelled like school girls. </p> 
        <p> As graduation apporached and came, I was planning on reporting to summer camp and classes as soon as I got out of high school. At a graduation party, my girlfriend pulled me aside to tell me she was pregnant. I was shocked, all my dreams seeminly vanished as I prepared to assume toe duties of fatherhood. After great though, I decided to call my coaches and let them know what was going on. Luckily they todl me if I worked things out qwith my ecclesiatical leader, they would allow me to sit out a semester and play the following season. In August of 2019, three months after graduating high school, my wife and I were married and we begun our life together. In January of 2020 we welcomed our son Rome and in June of 2022 we had our daughter Elida. We have the best life! </p>
